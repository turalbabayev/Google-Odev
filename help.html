    <h2>Google queries are simple yet powerful</h2>
    <p>
        To enter a query into Google, <span id="green-bold">just type in a few descriptive keywords and hit "search."</span> That's it! If you need them, however, we also provide a few advanced search operators.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> 
            <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"> 
                NEW!
            </span> 
            <span id="green-bold-15px">
                The "" operator.
            </span>
            Google automatically prefers pages where the query terms are found in close proximity. However, sometimes the only relevant pages are those where some or all of the query words occur as a phrase. You can
            <span id="green-bold">
                enclose words in double-quotes
            </span>
            ("like this") to force the words to appear together in all returned documents.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"> 
                NEW!
            </span> 
            <span id="green-bold-15px">
                The "" operator.
            </span>
            Sometimes it is helpful to choose words to exclude from a search. That is, you want all relevant result pages except those containing a certain word. We support this "not" functionality with the "-" operator. Simply
            <span id="green-bold">
                prefix your query word with a -
            </span>
            (-like -this) to make Google ignore all pages containing that word.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span id="green-bold-15px">
                Automatic AND.
            </span>
            Google only supports "and" queries. That is, it only returns pages that include all the query terms. The + operator, which enforces "and" behavior on some search engines, is unnecessary on Google (though it can be used to include stopwords; see below).
